# RESEARCH

"We must do reeee-SEARRCH!" ~ Uncle Chan (from Adventures of Jackie Chan)

The purpose of this document is to collect all my readings and information
from around the web about how bees operate and hopefully translate this
into a working knowledge base to set the whole game from.

# What are the different bee types?

In general there are three bee types:
- Queen
- Drone
- Worker

## Queen

There should only be one queen in a given hive, it should be noted that 
according to this source: https://allisonsapiaries.com/queen-bee-controls-hive/

So what we can take away is that there should in most cases be only one
queen in a given hive (though this does not mean we should exclude this
rare case though...it may make it in as a rare chance).

# Drone

There should be only a few drones in a hive, but it should also be known
that a hive does not need drones to survive. A hive can operate without 
drones but they are needed for fertilising the queen during her initial 
"nupital flight" where the queen will mate with drones and fly off...the
drones will subsequently die after mating (according to Wikipedia).

Drones are "male" bees and when its winter they may get kicked out of the 
hive when resources are tight.

# Worker

Workers are female bees but do not give birth to larvae.

They can apparently though if the queen is deemed to be in poor health or
if the hive is missing its queen.

For the most part of a worker, they do many jobs, like in the PDF
highlighted above. But the jobs depend on the age of the worker bee.

Foraging or gathering pollen is for the older more mature bees. Whilst
the other roles are performed when the bee is younger.

Workers make up the majority of a hive.

# Stages of bee development

https://bees.techno-science.ca/english/bees/life-in-a-hive/stages.php

The general stages apply to all bee types and they are:
- egg
- larva
- pupa

After pupa they then grow into their respective "type" that they are to
become like: worker or queen (if a worker is constantly fed royal jelly)

From here the bee lives out its usual "type" of lifestyle.

Unfertilised eggs become drones, fertilised eggs become workers OR queens
(dependent on the food that is fed to the bee).

# How is royal jelly produced?

https://www.cebelarstvo-luzar.si/the-production-of-royal-jelly

Well according to sources, it seems that nurse bees produce royal jelly
and apparently its bitter and smells of rotten fruit?

# What is the minimum amount for a beehive to operate?

https://www.quora.com/How-many-bees-do-I-need-to-start-a-beehive

According to this, about 2400 workers + fertile queen is enough.

# Extra

Bees form winter clusters to survive colder temperatures.
