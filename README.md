# Bee

This is a honey clicker game where you play with a hive and take it
through the full lifecycle of a hive and you have to take care of
the hive as it matures and goes through various phases.

I kind of take inspiration from this code here:
https://github.com/MaelDrapier/react-simple-snake/blob/master/src/SnakeGame.jsx

I want to try and use this project to learn React Hooks without Redux.
